# 👋 Hi, I'm Davi!

I'm a **Computer Science student** and **Software Engineer**, passionate about back-end development and cloud technologies.  
Most of my recent work and studies are around **Java + Spring Boot** and the **AWS ecosystem**, always with a focus on building scalable, reliable systems.  
I like to keep learning and coding a **daily habit**.

## 🚀 What I'm Exploring
- ☕ **Java & Spring ecosystem** → building robust back-end services  
- ☁️ **AWS** → deploying apps on EC2, S3, DynamoDB, SQS and more  
- 🏗️ **System Design** → scalability, resilience, and performance  
- ⚙️ **Software Engineering** → scalable design & best practices
- 🧩 **Data Structures & Algorithms** → sharpening problem-solving
